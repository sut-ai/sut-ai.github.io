  content: "<p>One of CE-417's goals is to prepare you to apply fundamental Artificial\
    \ Intelligence and \nMachine Learning algorithms to semi-realistic tasks and ensure\
    \ that you have a solid \nunderstanding of the fundamentals of AI. The extensive\
    \ problem sets of the course are \ncurated to serve as a means for achieving this\
    \ purpose.\nPlease upload your answers to Quera on time; otherwise you would not\
    \ earn any \ncredit for them. Take a note of these points regarding your assignments:\n\
    * You will have <strong>6 Assignments</strong> Accounting for 50% of your overall\
    \ grading\n* You are given <strong>15 \u201Cgrace days\u201D</strong> (self-granted\
    \ extensions) in total for each assignment,\n  which you can use to give yourself\
    \ extra time without penalty.\n* Every assignment has a hard deadline \u2014 which\
    \ is <strong>7</strong> days after the original due date (except for the last\
    \ assignment \n  which has no delay)\u2014 after which no submission is accepted.\
    \ \n* Delays are calculated hourly; minutes and seconds are rounded up.\n* You\
    \ can choose how you wish to distribute your grace-days among your assignments\
    \ at the\n  end of the semester.\nIf you have any questions regarding the problems,\
    \ visit the appropriate forum in Quera. \nKeep in mind that no changes can be\
    \ made to assignments at the last minute; therefore, please \nhave a look at the\
    \ questions at least a week before the assignment's due date. No deadline will\
    \ \nbe extended, and it is entirely on you to manage your \ntime and use your\
    \ grace days accordingly. Finally, a word of advice, don't procrastinate \neverything\
