    \ <p>Sharif University of Technology</p> <p>In this course you will learn what\
    \ Artificial Intelligence (AI) is, explore use cases and applications of AI, understand\
    \ AI concepts and terms like machine learning, deep learning and neural networks.\
    \ You will be exposed to various issues and concerns surrounding AI such as ethics\
    \ and bias, &amp; jobs, and get advice from experts about learning and starting\
    \ a career in AI. You will also demonstrate AI in action with a mini project.\
    \ \nThis course does not require any programming or computer science expertise\
    \ and is designed to introduce the basics of AI to anyone whether you have a technical\
    \ background or not.</p>"

  content: "<p>Problem Sets</p> <p>Sets of Artificial Intelligence problems</p> <p>One\
    \ of CE-417's goals is to prepare you to apply fundamental Artificial Intelligence\
    \ and \nMachine Learning algorithms to semi-realistic tasks and ensure that you\
    \ have a solid \nunderstanding of the fundamentals of AI. The extensive problem\
    \ sets of the course are \ncurated to serve as a means for achieving this purpose.</p>\n\
    <p>Please upload your answers to Quera on time; otherwise you would not earn any\
    \ \ncredit for them. Take a note of these points regarding your assignments:</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>You will have <strong>7 Assignments</strong> Accounting for 50% of your\
    \ overall grading</li>\n<li>You are given <strong>20 \u201Cgrace days\u201D</strong>\
    \ (self-granted extensions) in total for each assignment,\n  which you can use\
    \ to give yourself extra time without penalty.</li>\n<li>Every assignment has\
    \ a hard deadline \u2014 which is <strong>seven</strong> days after the original\
    \ due date (except for the last assignment \n  which has no delay)\u2014 after\
    \ which no submission is accepted. </li>\n<li>Delays are calculated hourly; minutes\
    \ and seconds are rounded up.</li>\n<li>You can choose how you wish to distribute\
    \ your grace-days among your assignments at the\n  end of the semester.</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<p>If you have any questions regarding the problems, visit the appropriate\
    \ forum in Quera. \nKeep in mind that no changes can be made to assignments at\
    \ the last minute; therefore, please \nhave a look at the questions at least a\
    \ week before the assignment's due date. No deadline will \nbe extended, and it\
    \ is entirely on you to manage your \ntime and use your grace days accordingly.\
    \ Finally, A word of advice, don't procrastinate \neverything up until the deadlines.</p>\
