    \ Course</p> M. Soleymani Baghshah <p>In this course you will learn what Artificial\
    \ Intelligence (AI) is, explore use cases and applications of AI, understand AI\
    \ concepts and terms like machine learning, deep learning and neural networks.\
    \ You will be exposed to various issues and concerns surrounding AI such as ethics\
    \ and bias, &amp; jobs, and get advice from experts about learning and starting\
    \ a career in AI. You will also demonstrate AI in action with a mini project.\
    \ \nThis course does not require any programming or computer science expertise\
    \ and is designed to introduce the basics of AI to anyone whether you have a technical\
    \ background or not.</p>"

    \ Intelligence and \nMachine Learning algorithms to semi-realistic tasks and ensure\
    \ that you have a solid \nunderstanding of the fundamentals of AI. The extensive\
    \ problem sets of the course are \ncurated to serve as a means for achieving this\
    \ purpose.</p>\n<p>Please upload your answers to Quera on time; otherwise you\
    \ would not earn any \ncredit for them. Take a note of these points regarding\
    \ your assignments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weekly Theoretical assignments will be released\
    \ every Thursday covering \n  that week's topics. (Accounting for 10.5% of your\
    \ overall grading)</li>\n<li>You will have <strong>five mini-projects</strong>\
    \ (Accounting for 29.5% of your overall grading 7% of which \n  would be for potential\
    \ theoretical questions)</li>\n<li>You are given <strong>15 \u201Cgrace days\u201D\
    </strong> (self-granted extensions) in total for each assignment,\n  which you\
    \ can use to give yourself extra time without penalty.</li>\n<li>Every assignment\
    \ has a hard deadline \u2014for theoretical assignments <strong>three</strong>\
    \ and for practical \n  assignments <strong>seven</strong> days after the original\
    \ due date (except for the last practical assignment \n  which has no delay)\u2014\
    \ after which no submission is accepted. </li>\n<li>Delays are calculated hourly;\
    \ minutes and seconds are rounded up.</li>\n<li>You can choose how you wish to\
    \ distribute your grace-days among your assignments at the\n  end o the semester.</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<p>If you have any questions regarding the problems, visit the appropriate\
    \ forum in Quera. \nKeep in mind that no changes can be made to assignments at\
    \ the last minute; therefore, please \nhave a look at the questions at least three\
    \ days before Weekly deadlines and a week before the \nmini-projects due date.\
    \ No deadline will be extended, and it is entirely on you to manage your \ntime\
    \ and use your grace days accordingly. Finally, A word of advice, don't procrastinate\
    \ \neverything up until the deadlines.</p> <p>Sets of Artificial Intelligence\
