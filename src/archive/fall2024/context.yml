    type: section
    text: >
      This course offers a gentle introduction to the concepts and methodologies in Artificial Intelligence from
      both theoretical and practical perspectives. This includes designing intelligent agents through techniques
      such as state-space search methods, knowledge representation and inference, and Machine Learning. By the end
      of this course, students are expected to have the ability to develop intelligent solutions for semi-real
      world problems using the appropriate methods discussed in the course. Furthermore, they are expected to gain
      knowledge and experience in analyzing the inner workings of these methods and customizing them for specific
      problems.

      - title: Homeworks
        text: >
          Five series of homework assignments will be distributed in this course. 
          Assignments will be released on Saturday midnight every other week. 
          The answers must be submitted on 
          [Dr. Rohban's Quera](https://quera.org/course/add_to_course/course/18700/) and [Mr. Fereydooni's Quera](https://quera.org/course/add_to_course/course/18731/).
          Regarding the late submission policy, you can submit answers with total delay
          of 10 days with no penalty through the semester. Any additional delays will lead to a 0.5% reduction
          in the assignment grade for every hour of delay. This is  illustrated in the figure below, where â„Ž representsthe amount of delay in hours:
          <div class="mx-auto max-w-xl">![Delay Coefficient graph]({{ static("images/course/delay_coef_2.png") }} "Delay coefficient")</div>
          Notably, in order to prioritize fairness and consistency for all students, a request for a deadline extension must be emailed to the instructor and head TAs at least 72 hours before the deadline through E-Mail.
