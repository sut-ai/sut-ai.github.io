    type: section
    text: >
      This course offers a gentle introduction to the concepts and methodologies in Artificial Intelligence from
      both theoretical and practical perspectives. This includes designing intelligent agents through techniques
      such as state-space search methods, knowledge representation and inference, and Machine Learning. By the end
      of this course, students are expected to have the ability to develop intelligent solutions for semi-real
      world problems using the appropriate methods discussed in the course. Furthermore, they are expected to gain
      knowledge and experience in analyzing the inner workings of these methods and customizing them for specific
      problems.

      - title: Homeworks
        text: >
          Five series of homework assignments will be distributed in this course.
          Assignments will be released on Sunday midnight every other week. 
          Students will have 14 days to submit their answers on
          [Quera](https://quera.org/course/add_to_course/course/13173/). Regarding the late submission policy, you can
          submit answers with total delay of 5 days (maximum of 2 days for each submission) with no penalty.
          Any more delays and 1% of the assignment grade will be deducted for each hour of delay. Please note that
          submissions made between midnight (12 AM) and noon (12 PM) will not be considered. 
          You can submit your answers during this interval, but the submission timestamp will be recorded
          as 12 PM on the same day. 
          Delays will be calculated on an hourly scale, as illustrated in the figure below and described by 
          equation following the figure, where $h$ represents the amount of delay in hours.
          <div class="mx-auto max-w-xl">![Delay Coefficient graph]({{ static("images/course/delay_coef.png") }} "Delay coefficient")</div>
          $$
           \begin{cases}
            88 & 0 < h < 12 \\
            100 - h & 12 \le h \le 24 \\
            64 & 24 < h < 36 \\
            100 - h & 36 \le h \le 48 \\
           \end{cases}
          $$
      - title: Collaboration, Academic Honesty, and Plagiarism
