    type: section
    text: >
      This course offers a gentle introduction to the concepts and methodologies in Artificial Intelligence from
      both theoretical and practical perspectives. This includes designing intelligent agents through techniques
      such as state-space search methods, knowledge representation and inference, and Machine Learning. By the end
      of this course, students are expected to have the ability to develop intelligent solutions for semi-real
      world problems using the appropriate methods discussed in the course. Furthermore, they are expected to gain
      knowledge and experience in analyzing the inner workings of these methods and customizing them for specific
      problems.

      - title: Prerequisites
        text: >
          Knowledge and experience of a general-purpose programming language (Python), Data Structures and Algorithms,
          and ideally Probability and Statistics (Random Variables, (Joint) Probability Mass Functions,
          Conditional Probability, Independence, Bayes Theorem) and Linear Algebra.
          *It is highly recommended to have the Engineering Probability and Linear Algebra courses passed
          before taking this course.*
      - title: Classes
        text: >
          Even though the instruction of both groups is jointly coordinated, each instructor will have their own class.
          Dr. Soleymani's class will be held on Sundays and Tuesdays from 15:00 to 16:30, and Dr. Rohban's class will
          take place on Sundays and Tuesdays from 10:30 to 12:00. Classes will be held in person by default,
          but in special circumstances, the class might be conducted virtually (with prior announcements), at
          [https://vc.sharif.edu/ch/soleymani](https://vc.sharif.edu/ch/soleymani) or
          [https://vc.sharif.edu/ch/rohban](https://vc.sharif.edu/ch/rohban).
      - title: Grading
        text: >
          Assessment of students of both groups will be identical. Please note that grades will be calculated out of $21.5$.

            - **1$^{\text{st}}$ Midterm Exam**: $3.0$ points; 1402/08/18 9:00 AM.
            - **2$^{\text{st}}$ Midterm Exam**: $4.0$ points; 1402/09/30 9:00 AM.

      - title: Exams
        text: >
          Students' learning will be assessed through two midterms and a final exam. These exams will 
          be held on the following dates, and students are required to participate in them.

            - **1$^{\text{st}}$ Midterm Exam**: 1402/08/18 9:00 AM.
            - **2$^{\text{st}}$ Midterm Exam**: 1402/09/30 9:00 AM.
            - **Final Exam**: 1402/10/21 9:00 AM (as scheduled in EDU).
      - title: Homeworks
        text: >
          Five series of homework assignments will be distributed in this course.
          Assignments will be released on Sunday midnight every other week. 
          Students will have 14 days to submit their answers on
          [Quera](https://quera.org/course/add_to_course/course/13173/). Regarding the late submission policy, you can
          submit answers with total delay of 5 days (maximum of 2 days for each submission) with no penalty.
          Any more delays and 1% of the assignment grade will be deducted for each hour of delay. Please note that
          submissions made between midnight (12 AM) and noon (12 PM) will not be considered. 
          You can submit your answers during this interval, but the submission timestamp will be recorded
          as 12 PM on the same day. 
          Delays will be calculated on an hourly scale, as illustrated in the figure below and described by 
          equation following the figure, where $h$ represents the amount of delay in hours.
          <div class="mx-auto max-w-xl">![Delay Coefficient graph]({{ static("images/course/delay_coef.jpg") }} "Delay coefficient")</div>
          $$
           \begin{cases}
            88 & 0 < h < 12 \\
            100 - h & 12 \le h \le 24 \\
            64 & 24 < h < 36 \\
            100 - h & 36 \le h \le 48 \\
            40 & 48 < h < 60 \\
            100 - h & 60 \le h \le 72 \\
           \end{cases}
          $$
      - title: Collaboration, Academic Honesty, and Plagiarism
        text: >
