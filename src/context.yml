    type: section
    text: >
      This course offers a gentle introduction to the concepts and methodologies in Artificial Intelligence from
      both theoretical and practical perspectives. This includes designing intelligent agents through techniques
      such as state-space search methods, knowledge representation and inference, and Machine Learning. By the end
      of this course, students are expected to have the ability to develop intelligent solutions for semi-real
      world problems using the appropriate methods discussed in the course. Furthermore, they are expected to gain
      knowledge and experience in analyzing the inner workings of these methods and customizing them for specific
      problems.

      - title: Prerequisites
        text: >
          Knowledge and experience of a general-purpose programming language (Python), Data Structures and Algorithms,
          and ideally Probability and Statistics (Random Variables, (Joint) Probability Mass Functions,
          Conditional Probability, Independence, Bayes Theorem) and Linear Algebra.
          *It is highly recommended to have the Engineering Probability and Linear Algebra courses passed
          before taking this course.*
      - title: Classes
        text: >
          The class is scheduled for Sundays and Tuesdays from 13:30 to 15:00. By default, classes will be 
          held in person; however, under special circumstances, the class might be held virtually with prior 
          announcements. The virtual class link is 
          [https://vc.sharif.edu/ch/rohban](https://vc.sharif.edu/ch/rohban).
      - title: Grading
        text: >
          Please note that grades will be calculated out of $22.0$, 
          with the respective grades for each section provided below:

            - **Homework Assignments**: $7.5 + 0.5$ points.
              - Five Series, each $1.5$ points and $0.5$ bonus point in total.
            - **Presentation**: $1.0$ point.
            - **Quiz**: $1.5$ points.
            - **Midterm Exam**: $4.5$ points.
            - **Final Exam**: $5.5$ points.
            - **Project**: $+1.5$ point.
              - The project is optional but offers the advantage of bonus points.
          
          Notably, achieving at least 40% of exam total grades (Midterm+Final) is required to pass the course.
      - title: Exams
        text: >
          Students' learning will be assessed through two quizzes, a midterm, and a final exam. 
          These exams will be held on the following dates, and participation is mandatory for all students.

            - **1$^{\text{st}}$ Quiz **: 1403/01/26 13:30 PM.
            - **2$^{\text{st}}$ Quiz **: 1403/03/06 13:30 PM.
            - **Midterm Exam**: 1403/02/13 13:30 PM.
            - **Final Exam**: 1403/04/03 9:00 AM (as scheduled in EDU).
      - title: Homeworks
        text: >
          Five series of homework assignments will be distributed in this course. 
          Assignments will be released on Saturday midnight every other week. 
          Students will have about 20 days to submit their answers on 
          [Quera](https://quera.org/course/add_to_course/course/16535/).
          Regarding the late submission policy, you can submit answers with total delay
          of 10 days with no penalty. Any additional delays will lead to a 0.5% reduction
          in the assignment grade for every hour of delay. This is  illustrated in
          the figure below, where â„Ž represents
          the amount of delay in hours
          <div class="mx-auto max-w-xl">![Delay Coefficient graph]({{ static("images/course/delay_coef_2.png") }} "Delay coefficient")</div>
          To prioritize fairness and consistency for all students, a request for a deadline extension must be emailed to the instructor and head TAs at least 72 hours before the deadline.
      - title: Collaboration, Academic Honesty, and Plagiarism
        text: >
          There will be a zero-tolerance policy for cheating or copying homework assignments. The first time you
          are caught, we will refer you to the committee, and you will fail the course. Please refer
          to the Education Committee's statement on homework etiquette.

  - title: Course Pages
    type: section
    text: >
      - [**https://sut-ai.github.io/**](https://sut-ai.github.io/): This is the main page of our course and all exercises, slides and course resources will be placed in it.
      
      - Quera, [**https://quera.org/course/add_to_course/course/16535/**](https://quera.org/course/add\_to\_course/course/16535/): Delivery of exercises and announcements will be done entirely through Quera. Make sure you enter an email on Quera that you check regularly. Your questions from the exercises will also be answered in Quera.
